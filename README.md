# Autheo Dev

## Included packages and tools
- Bolt.diy - Multi LLM AI-powered full-stack web-dev for NodeJS based app.  Browser based.
- Flowise - Drag&Drop UI to build your customized LLM flow
- Gitea - Self-hosted GitHub-like services (go based).  Code review, team collab, package registry, CI/CD, etc.
- Mailu - Local email server
- Mattermost - self hosted messaging for team collab (PostgreSQL backend)
- N8N - Workflow Automation
- OpenProject - Project Management
- Radicle Heartwood - Code collaboration and publishing stack, UI and cmdline (aâ€™la GitLab, GitHub)
- Sonarqube - static/dynamic code analysis (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, etc.)

## Prerequisites
- A Linux or Linux-like OS (Mac Terminal, Windows with WSL or Cygwin, etc.)
- Docker must be installed on your build machine

## Building
1. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd autheo-dev
   ```
3. Start the services:
   ```sh
   ./autheo.sh start
   ```
4. To see additional commands (e.g., stop, status, etc.):
   ```sh
   ./autheo.sh help
   ```

## Accessing the Web UI
Once all services are started, you can connect to the web UI through a browser by pointing it to:

`127.0.0.1` which is your loopback address, accessible only from your local machine.
For access by other devices on the same network, run this:

```sh
ifconfig | grep "inet " && docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' autheo-devhub-webui
```

This should report your loopback, the LAN address (for other devices on you network), and finally the address of container's IP within the Docker network.
